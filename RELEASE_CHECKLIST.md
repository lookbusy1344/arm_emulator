## Release Process

### Step 1: Create Release Tag ✅
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 - First production release"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Automated Build Process ✅
The following will happen automatically when the tag is pushed:
1. GitHub Actions will trigger the build-release.yml workflow
2. Binaries will be built for all platforms:
   - `arm-emulator-linux-amd64`
   - `arm-emulator-macos-arm64`
   - `arm-emulator-win-amd64.exe`
   - `arm-emulator-win-arm64.exe`
3. SHA256 checksums will be generated for each binary
4. A combined SHA256SUMS file will be created
5. A GitHub Release will be created with all artifacts

### Step 3: Release Verification
After automated release completes:
- [ ] Verify all 4 platform binaries are attached to the release
- [ ] Verify SHA256SUMS file is present
- [ ] Verify individual .sha256 files are attached
- [ ] Download and test at least one binary
- [ ] Verify SHA256 checksum matches
- [ ] Run basic smoke tests (hello.s, arithmetic.s)

### Step 4: Release Announcement
After verification:
- [ ] Update GitHub Release description with CHANGELOG content
- [ ] Mark release as "Latest Release"
- [ ] Announce on project communication channels (if any)
- [ ] Update any external documentation or references
