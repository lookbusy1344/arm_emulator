# CodeQL security analysis
# Note: Swift analysis is disabled due to known issues with CodeQL's DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
# tracing on macOS ARM64 with hardened Xcode binaries. The build succeeds but CodeQL
# cannot trace the Swift compilation. See: https://github.com/github/codeql-action/issues/2506
# Swift code is still built and tested in ci.yml
