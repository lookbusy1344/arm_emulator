## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### Critical (Fix Immediately)
1. **2 go vet warnings** - Interface name collision in `vm/memory.go`
   - `ReadByte/WriteByte` methods conflict with `io.ByteReader/ByteWriter`
   - **Fix time:** 10 minutes

### High Priority
2. **CI/CD needs enhancement** - Only tests on Ubuntu
   - Should test on macOS and Windows
   - Should report coverage
   - Uses Go 1.21 (should be 1.25)
   - **Fix time:** 4-6 hours

3. **Code coverage below target** - 61% vs 85% goal
   - VM core has no direct tests
   - Debugger at 47.9%
   - Parser error paths untested
   - **Fix time:** 4-6 hours

### Medium Priority
4. **Tracing not connected** - Infrastructure exists but not wired up
   - `vm/trace.go` implemented but not called from `VM.Step()`
   - **Fix time:** 2-3 hours

5. **Parser limitations** - 3 failing tests
   - Cannot parse register lists: `{R0, R1, R2}`
   - Cannot parse shifted operands: `R0, LSL #2`
   - **Fix time:** 8-10 hours

6. **No performance benchmarks** - Can't measure optimization impact
   - **Fix time:** 4-6 hours

## 🎯 Recommended Priorities
