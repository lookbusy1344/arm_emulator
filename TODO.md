**Code Size:** 46,257 lines of Go code
**Example Programs:** 49 programs, all fully functional (100% success rate)

## Medium Priority Tasks

### Duplicate Register State Tracking
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 4-5 hours
**Type:** Refactoring/Code Quality

**Problem:**
Three independent systems track "last register state":
- `vm/trace.go` - `lastSnapshot` map
- `vm/register_trace.go` - `lastRegValues` map
- `debugger/tui.go` - `PrevRegisters` array

Code duplication creates maintenance burden and potential inconsistency in register change detection.

**Solution:** Extract into shared `RegisterSnapshot` type with methods:
- `ChangedRegs(other *RegisterSnapshot) []string`
- `Capture(cpu *CPU)`
- `GetRegister(name string) uint32`

Use consistently across all three locations.

**Files:**
- `vm/trace.go`
- `vm/register_trace.go`
- `debugger/tui.go`

### Syscall Error Handling Asymmetry
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Effort:** 3-4 hours
**Type:** Error Handling

**Problem:**
Syscall documentation distinguishes between:
- "VM integrity errors" (should return Go error and halt)
- "Expected failures" (should return 0xFFFFFFFF in R0, continue)

However, this isn't consistently applied. Some handlers propagate Go errors for validation failures when they should return 0xFFFFFFFF.

**Example:** File operations like `handleOpen()` may panic or return errors instead of 0xFFFFFFFF on failure.

**Solution:** Create error classification system:
```go
type SyscallError struct {
    IsVMError bool // true = halt, false = return 0xFFFFFFFF
    Message   string
}
```

Audit all syscall handlers for consistency.

**Files:**
- `vm/syscall.go` (all handler functions)
- Create new file: `vm/syscall_error.go`

---

### Additional Diagnostic Modes

**Proposed Extensions:**
- [ ] **Data Flow Tracing** (6-8 hours) - Track data movement between registers/memory, value provenance, data dependency tracking, taint analysis
- [ ] **Cycle-Accurate Timing Simulation** (8-10 hours) - Estimate ARM2 instruction timing, pipeline stall simulation, memory access latency, performance bottleneck identification
- [ ] **Memory Region Heatmap Visualization** (4-6 hours) - Track access frequency per region, HTML/graphical output, color-coded visualization
- [ ] **Reverse Execution Log** (10-12 hours) - Record state for backwards stepping, circular buffer of previous N instructions, time-travel debugging

---

### Performance & Benchmarking
**Effort:** 10-15 hours

- [ ] Create benchmark tests (VM, parser, TUI)
- [ ] Document performance targets
- [ ] Run CPU and memory profiling
- [ ] Create `docs/performance_analysis.md`
- [ ] Implement optimizations if needed

---

## Low Priority Tasks (Optional)

### Symbol Resolution Caching
**Priority:** LOW-MEDIUM
**Effort:** 2-3 hours
**Type:** Performance Optimization

**Problem:**
`ResolveAddress()` does binary search for every trace entry. With 100,000+ trace entries, this is 100,000 binary searches. The binary search is already efficient, but locality of reference is ignored.

**Solution:** Add simple cache for recently resolved symbols:
```go
type SymbolResolver struct {
    // existing fields...
    cacheAddr   uint32
    cacheName   string
    cacheOffset uint32
}

// Check cache (within 256 byte window) before binary search
```

Expected improvement: 5-15% speedup in trace output generation.

**Files:**
- `vm/symbol_resolver.go` (ResolveAddress method)

### TestAssert_MessageWraparound Test Investigation
**Status:** SKIPPED - Low Priority
**Priority:** LOW
**Effort:** 2-4 hours

**Current Behavior:**
The `TestAssert_MessageWraparound` test in `tests/unit/vm/security_fixes_test.go` is currently skipped. The ASSERT syscall does have wraparound protection and stops reading at address boundaries (reads 15 chars instead of wrapping), which is safe behavior. However, the test expects an explicit "wraparound" error message.

**Issue:**
When ASSERT reads a message starting at 0xFFFFFFF0 with no null terminator:
- Expects: Error containing "wraparound"
- Actual: Reads 15 characters (ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO) and returns "ASSERTION FAILED" error
- The 16th character at 0xFFFFFFFF is not being read

**Investigation Needed:**
- Determine why reading from address 0xFFFFFFFF fails or returns 0
- Verify memory segment boundary handling at maximum address
- Consider if current behavior (stopping at 15 chars) is acceptable
- Update test expectations or fix ASSERT handler accordingly

**Files:**
- `tests/unit/vm/security_fixes_test.go` (line 223)
- `vm/syscall.go` `handleAssert()` function (line 940)

### Later ARM Architecture Extensions (Optional)

These are **not** part of ARM2 but could be added for broader compatibility:

**ARMv2a Atomic Operations** (Effort: 4-6 hours)
- [ ] SWP (Swap Word) - Atomically swap 32-bit value between register and memory
- [ ] SWPB (Swap Byte) - Atomically swap 8-bit value between register and memory
- **Purpose:** Synchronization primitives for multi-threaded/multi-processor systems (spinlocks, semaphores, mutex)
- **Note:** Introduced in ARMv2a (ARM3), not original ARM2. ARM2 was single-processor without multi-threading support.

**ARMv2 Coprocessor Interface** (Effort: 20-30 hours)
- [ ] CDP, LDC, STC, MCR, MRC - Coprocessor operations
- [ ] Full coprocessor emulation framework

**Note:** The emulator has complete ARM2 instruction set coverage. All planned ARMv3/ARMv3M extensions have been completed. These remaining extensions are from later architectures.

---

### Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline (Optional)
**Effort:** 2-3 hours (partially complete)

**Remaining:**
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting (codecov integration)
- [ ] Add coverage threshold enforcement in CI (currently 75% local)
- [ ] Add race detector to CI pipeline (works locally but not in ci.yml)

---

### GUI E2E Test Quality Improvements (Optional)

**Remaining Work (UI Features Not Implemented):**
- [ ] Implement theme toggle UI (2 skipped tests in visual.spec.ts)
- [ ] Implement breakpoint enable/disable checkbox (1 skipped test in breakpoints.spec.ts)
- [ ] Implement clear-all-breakpoints button (1 skipped test in breakpoints.spec.ts)
- [ ] Scroll test for memory view (1 skipped test - memory view is virtualized)

**Test Quality Improvements:**
- [ ] **Error message verification in error-scenarios.spec.ts** - Currently tests only check errors exist (`toBeTruthy()`), not actual error message content
- [ ] **Remove hardcoded waits from visual.spec.ts** - 5 `waitForTimeout()` calls should be replaced with proper state checks
- [ ] **Remove hardcoded waits from memory.spec.ts** - 2 `waitForTimeout(200)` calls should use state-based assertions
- [ ] **Remove hardcoded waits from breakpoints.spec.ts** - 3 `waitForTimeout()` calls should use `waitForFunction()`
- [ ] **Remove hardcoded waits from execution.spec.ts** - 12 `waitForTimeout()` calls should be replaced with proper state checks
