## Known Issues

### Literal Pool Memory Corruption Bug üêõ OPEN

**Status:** Active bug affecting programs with many `LDR Rx, =label` instructions

**Symptoms:**
- Programs with multiple `LDR Rx, =label` instructions can corrupt memory at offsets 8 and 12
- Reading from stack offsets +8 and +12 returns incorrect values (-1073741806 and 25)
- Error at program end: "unimplemented SWI: 0xNNNNNN" with invalid SWI numbers
- The bug does not occur when using direct register addressing without literal pools

**Evidence:**
- Created test program that stores values at SP+0, SP+4, SP+8, SP+12
- Stores work correctly: 100, 200, 300, 400
- Reads return: 100, 200, -1073741806, 25 (offsets 8 and 12 are corrupted)
- Integration test `TestStackFile` reproduces the bug when using `LDR R0, =msg`
- Same test passes when avoiding literal pool loads

**Root Cause (Updated after investigation):**
- Programs with many `LDR Rx, =label` instructions execute correctly but fail to halt properly
- After producing correct output, execution continues past the final `SWI #0x00` (exit)
- PC advances into memory containing literal pool entries or data
- These values are interpreted as invalid SWI instructions (e.g., SWI 0x04FFC4, SWI 0xCD)
- The literal pool placement formula `(currentAddr & 0xFFFFF000) + 0x1000` may cause overlap issues
- Simple programs (1-2 literals) work; complex programs (8+ literals) fail

**Investigation Notes (2025-10-11):**
- Added `LiteralPoolStart` field to encoder to control literal pool placement
- Tried placing literal pool between instructions and data ‚Üí still fails
- Tried placing literal pool after all data ‚Üí still fails
- Added PC-relative offset validation (must be within 4KB) ‚Üí helped but didn't solve it
- Integration test `TestStackFile` actually PASSES (stack corruption may be different manifestation)
- The issue may be related to execution not halting properly, not just literal placement

**Workaround:**
- Minimize use of `LDR Rx, =label` in programs
- Use direct values or register-to-register operations where possible
- Note: `examples/addressing_modes.s` still exhibits the bug despite workarounds

**Files Modified:**
- `encoder/memory.go` - Added `LiteralPoolStart` support and offset validation
- `main.go` - Set literal pool start address during assembly
- `tests/integration/syscalls_test.go` - Updated test helper with same logic

**Test Case:**
- Example programs: `examples/addressing_modes.s` (8 literals), `examples/arrays.s` (16 literals)
- Both produce correct output but then hit runtime errors
- Integration test: `tests/integration/test_stack_file_test.go` (PASSES - may not reproduce this specific issue)

**Next Steps:**
- Investigate why execution continues after `SWI #0x00` in programs with many literals
- Check if branch target calculations are affected by literal pool presence
- Verify SWI #0x00 handler properly sets VM state to halt
- Consider implementing proper multi-pass assembly with literal pool size calculation

**Effort:** 8-12 hours (complex issue requiring deeper investigation)

**Priority:** High (affects program correctness)

## Phase 11: Production Hardening

### Task 1: Fix Integer Conversion Issues

**Status:** Detected by gosec linter (G115 rule)

**Issues Found:** 56 integer conversions that could potentially overflow
- uint32 ‚Üî int32 conversions (sign bit reinterpretation)
- int ‚Üí uint32 conversions (negative values become large positive)
- int64 ‚Üí uint32 conversions (truncation of high bits)
- uint32 ‚Üí uint16/uint8 conversions (truncation)

**Examples:**
- `debugger/commands.go:388` - uint32 ‚Üí int32 (display formatting)
- `debugger/expr_parser.go:251` - int64 ‚Üí uint32 (expression evaluation)
- `encoder/branch.go:48` - uint32 ‚Üí int32 (has bounds check, but flagged)
- `vm/memory.go:159` - int ‚Üí uint32 (length comparisons)
- `vm/syscall.go:269` - int ‚Üí uint32 (buffer size)

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Review all 56 flagged conversions
- [ ] Add bounds checking where needed
- [ ] Use safe conversion functions for critical paths
- [ ] Document intentional conversions that are safe
- [ ] Consider implementing safecast helper functions

**Files Affected:**
- debugger/commands.go (5 instances)
- debugger/expr_parser.go (1 instance)
- debugger/tui.go (4 instances)
- encoder/branch.go (2 instances)
- encoder/encoder.go (2 instances)
- encoder/memory.go (2 instances)
- vm/memory.go (9 instances)
- vm/memory_multi.go (4 instances)
- vm/syscall.go (9 instances)
- vm/inst_memory.go (2 instances)
- parser/parser.go (5 instances)
- main.go (1 instance)

**Effort:** 6-10 hours

**Priority:** High (security/correctness issue)

### Task 2: Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline

**Status:** Basic CI exists with Go 1.25

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Configure matrix builds (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting (codecov)
- [ ] Add coverage threshold enforcement (70% minimum)
- [ ] Add race detector to tests
- [ ] Upload test results as CI artifacts

**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Priority:** High

---

### Task 4: Code Coverage Analysis

**Current:** ~40% (estimated)
**Target:** 75%+

**Focus Areas:**
- [ ] VM package tests (initialization, reset, execution modes)
- [ ] Parser error path tests
- [ ] Debugger expression tests (error handling)

**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Priority:** Medium-High

---

### Task 5: Memory Trace Integration (BROKEN)

**Status:** Infrastructure exists but not functional - `--mem-trace` flag does not work

**Problem:**
- MemoryTrace infrastructure is set up correctly (created, started, flushed in main.go)
- RecordRead() and RecordWrite() methods exist in vm/trace.go but are never called
- Result: Empty trace files are created with no memory access data

**Root Cause:**
- Load/store instruction handlers in `vm/inst_memory.go` call memory operations (ReadWord, WriteWord, etc.) but don't record traces
- Memory read/write functions in `vm/memory.go` don't have access to VM's MemoryTrace
- Same issue likely exists in multi-register transfers (`vm/memory_multi.go`) and other memory operations

**Fix Required:**
- [ ] Add MemoryTrace recording calls after each memory operation in `vm/inst_memory.go`
- [ ] Handle all memory access types: word (lines 79, 102), byte (lines 74, 99), halfword (lines 69, 95)
- [ ] Add recording for multi-register transfers in `vm/memory_multi.go` (LDM/STM instructions)
- [ ] Check if MemoryTrace is enabled before recording (nil check)
- [ ] Pass correct parameters: sequence number (vm.CPU.Cycles), PC, address, value, size ("WORD", "BYTE", "HALF")
- [ ] Add integration test to verify memory trace output is generated
- [ ] Optionally connect ExecutionTrace to VM.Step()
- [ ] Optionally connect Statistics to VM operations

**Files to Modify:**
- `vm/inst_memory.go` - Add RecordRead/RecordWrite calls after memory operations (lines 69-104)
- `vm/memory_multi.go` - Add RecordRead/RecordWrite calls in LDM/STM handlers

**Effort:** 2-3 hours

**Priority:** Medium (advertised feature that doesn't work)
