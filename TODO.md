## High Priority

### 1. Expression Parser Improvements (Phase 5 Enhancement)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Implementation:** The expression parser has been upgraded with a proper two-phase tokenizer and precedence-climbing parser.

**Completed Features:**
- ✅ All numeric literals work (decimal, hex, binary, octal)
- ✅ Register references work
- ✅ Symbol lookups work
- ✅ Memory dereferencing works (`[addr]`, `*addr`)
- ✅ Arithmetic operations work (`10 + 20`, `5 * 6`, `0x10 + 0x20`)
- ✅ Bitwise operations work (`0xFF & 0x0F`, `0xF0 | 0x0F`, `0xFF ^ 0x0F`)
- ✅ Shift operations work (`1 << 4`, `16 >> 2`)
- ✅ Register operations work (`r0 + r1`, `r0 + 5`, `r1 - r0`)
- ✅ Operator precedence correctly implemented
- ✅ Parentheses for grouping
- ✅ All previously disabled tests now passing

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `debugger/expr_lexer.go` - Tokenizer for debugger expressions
- Created `debugger/expr_parser.go` - Precedence-climbing parser with proper operator precedence
- Updated `debugger/expressions.go` - Refactored to use new lexer and parser
- All tests in `debugger/expressions_test.go` are now passing (100%)

**Completed:** 2025-10-10

## Bug Fixes & Technical Debt

### Known Issues

**No critical issues!** All parser limitations have been resolved:

1. ✅ **Expression Parser** - COMPLETE (see item #1 above)
   - Fixed hex numbers with arithmetic operators
   - Fixed register operations
   - Fixed hex numbers with bitwise operators
   - Completed: 2025-10-10

2. ✅ **Parser - Register Lists and Shifted Operands** - ALREADY WORKING

   **Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Parser already supported these features!

   **Verified Working Features:**
   - ✅ Register lists in PUSH/POP: `PUSH {R0, R1, R2}`, `POP {R0-R3}`
   - ✅ Shifted register operands in MOV: `MOV R1, R0, LSL #2`
   - ✅ Shifted register operands in data processing: `ADD R0, R1, R2, LSR #3`

   **Test Status:**
   - ✅ `TestProgram_Stack` - PASSING
   - ✅ `TestProgram_Loop` - PASSING
   - ✅ `TestProgram_Shifts` - PASSING

   **Implementation Notes:**
   - Parser in `parser/parser.go` already handles register lists (lines 422-444)
   - Parser already handles shifted operands (lines 463-487)
   - Encoder correctly processes these operands
   - All integration tests passing

### Technical Debt

1. **Code Coverage**
   - Current: ~40% estimated
   - Target: 85%+
   - Action: Add more comprehensive tests

2. **Error Messages**
   - Some error messages could be more descriptive
   - Add suggestions for common mistakes
   - Improve error context

3. **Performance**
   - No profiling done yet
   - Potential optimization opportunities in fetch-decode-execute cycle
   - Memory allocations could be reduced
