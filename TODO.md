## Known Issues

### Example Program Issues (Non-Critical)

**Status:** 4 of 23 example programs have pre-existing bugs (83% functional rate)

1. **fibonacci.s** - Memory access violation at 0x81000000
   - Converted to ARM2-style syscalls but has underlying bug
   - Issue exists in original version before conversion
   - Program structure appears correct but crashes during execution
   - **Diagnostic Details:**
     - Error occurs at PC=0x000080DC when calling `print_string` syscall
     - R0 contains invalid address 0x81000000 instead of valid string address
     - Error message: "failed to read string at 0x81000000: memory access violation"
     - 0x81000000 = 0b10000001_00000000_00000000_00000000 (looks like encoded instruction)
     - Simplified versions with same structure work fine (tested with 10 LDR pseudo-instructions)
     - Likely a **literal pool addressing bug** - LDR pseudo-instruction generating wrong address
     - May be related to PC-relative offset calculation or literal pool placement
     - Literal pool system places literals at `(dataAddr + 3) & ^uint32(3)` after data section
     - Each LDR pseudo-instruction must be within 4095 bytes of its literal (12-bit offset limit)
     - Similar programs with many strings work correctly, suggesting edge case in specific code structure

2. **calculator.s** - Memory access violation at 0x82000000
   - Converted to ARM2-style syscalls but has underlying bug
   - Issue exists in original version before conversion
   - Similar memory addressing issue as fibonacci.s
   - **Diagnostic Details:**
     - Similar literal pool addressing bug to fibonacci.s
     - 0x82000000 = 0b10000010_00000000_00000000_00000000 (also looks like encoded instruction)
     - Likely same root cause - LDR pseudo-instruction generating invalid address

3. **linked_list.s** - Unaligned word access at 0x0000000E
   - Pre-existing bug, not related to syscall conversion
   - Attempting unaligned memory access (must be 4-byte aligned)

4. **reverse_chatgpt.s** - Parse errors (syntax issues)
   - Multiple syntax errors preventing parsing
   - Pre-existing issues with assembly syntax

**Note:** All other 19 example programs work correctly. All tests pass (583 tests, 100%).

## Phase 11: Production Hardening

### Task 1: Fix Integer Conversion Issues ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ All G115 warnings resolved (2025-10-11)

**Issues Found:** 4 integer conversions in test files flagged by gosec (G115 rule)
- All were safe loop index conversions (int → uint32)
- Loop indices are always non-negative and bounded

**Resolution:**
- Added `#nosec G115` directives with justification comments
- Verified all conversions are mathematically safe (loop indices [0, N))
- Added clear documentation explaining why each conversion is safe

**Files Fixed:**
- tests/unit/parser/character_literals_test.go (2 instances)
- tests/unit/vm/memory_system_test.go (2 instances)
- tests/unit/vm/syscall_test.go (1 instance)

**Verification:**
- ✅ All tests pass (531 tests, 100%)
- ✅ golangci-lint reports 0 issues
- ✅ No G115 warnings remain

**Note:** The original estimate of 56 instances appears to have been from an earlier scan. Current codebase only had 4 instances, all in test files.

**Effort:** 1 hour (much less than estimated 6-10 hours)

**Priority:** High (security/correctness issue) - COMPLETED

### Task 2: Fix Literal Pool Bug (fibonacci.s, calculator.s)

**Status:** In investigation - diagnostics added to TODO.md (2025-10-11)

**Problem:**
- fibonacci.s and calculator.s crash with memory access violations at 0x81000000 and 0x82000000
- Invalid addresses (0x81000000, 0x82000000) look like encoded ARM instructions, not valid memory addresses
- LDR pseudo-instructions (`LDR r0, =label`) are generating wrong addresses in certain cases
- Simplified test programs with similar structure work fine, indicating edge case

**Root Cause (Suspected):**
- Literal pool addressing calculation issue in `encoder/memory.go`
- PC-relative offset may be incorrectly calculated or literal pool placement wrong
- May be related to specific combination of code size, data section size, and literal pool placement
- Should trigger "literal pool offset too large" error if offset > 4095 bytes, but doesn't

**Investigation Steps:**
- [ ] Add debug logging to `encoder/memory.go` to see literal pool addresses being generated
- [ ] Check what addresses are in `enc.LiteralPool` map for fibonacci.s
- [ ] Verify PC-relative offset calculation in `addLiteralToPool()` function
- [ ] Check if literal pool is being written to memory correctly in `main.go` line 714-718
- [ ] Test if issue occurs when literal pool offset approaches 4095 byte limit
- [ ] Create minimal reproduction case that triggers the bug

**Files to Investigate:**
- `encoder/memory.go:220-270` - `addLiteralToPool()` function
- `main.go:692-718` - Literal pool initialization and writing
- `examples/fibonacci.s` - Test case
- `examples/calculator.s` - Test case

**Effort:** 4-8 hours (investigation + fix + testing)

**Priority:** High (affects 2 example programs, may indicate broader encoder bug)

### Task 3: Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline

**Status:** Basic CI exists with Go 1.25

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Configure matrix builds (macOS, Windows, Linux)
- [ ] Add test coverage reporting (codecov)
- [ ] Add coverage threshold enforcement (70% minimum)
- [ ] Add race detector to tests
- [ ] Upload test results as CI artifacts

**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Priority:** High

---

### Task 4: Code Coverage Analysis

**Focus Areas:**
- [ ] VM package tests (initialization, reset, execution modes)
- [ ] Parser error path tests
- [ ] Debugger expression tests (error handling)

**Effort:** 4-6 hours

**Priority:** Medium-High

---

### Task 5: Memory Trace Integration ✅ COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ Completed (2025-10-11)

**Implementation:**
- Added MemoryTrace recording calls after each memory operation in `vm/inst_memory.go`
- Handled all memory access types: WORD, BYTE, and HALF (halfword)
- Added recording for multi-register transfers in `vm/memory_multi.go` (LDM/STM instructions)
- Added nil checks before recording to prevent crashes when tracing is disabled
- Pass correct parameters: sequence number (vm.CPU.Cycles), PC, address, value, size

**Files Modified:**
- `vm/inst_memory.go` - Added RecordRead/RecordWrite calls after load/store operations
- `vm/memory_multi.go` - Added RecordRead/RecordWrite calls in LDM/STM handlers
- `CLAUDE.md` - Removed "Known Issue" note about non-functional memory tracing

**Verification:**
- ✅ All 531 tests pass (100%)
- ✅ golangci-lint reports 0 issues
- ✅ Tested with examples/arrays.s - generated 93 memory trace entries
- ✅ Memory trace output format: `[seq] [TYPE] PC <- [addr] = value (SIZE)`
- ✅ Captures both READ and WRITE operations with correct addresses and values

**Effort:** 2 hours (as estimated)

**Priority:** Medium (advertised feature that wasn't working) - COMPLETED

**Status:** ✅ Completed (2025-10-11)
**Actual Effort:** 4 hours
**Priority:** Low-Medium

### Implemented Diagnostic Features

**Completed:**
- ✅ Code Coverage Mode - Track which instructions/addresses were executed vs not executed
- ✅ Stack Trace Mode - Track stack operations (push/pop/SP modifications) and detect overflow/underflow
- ✅ Flag Change Trace - Dedicated mode to track CPSR flag changes for debugging conditional logic

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `vm/coverage.go` - Code coverage tracker with execution counts and coverage percentage

- Integrated all trackers into VM execution flow
- Added command-line flags: `--coverage`, `--stack-trace`, `--flag-trace`
- All modes support both text and JSON output formats
- Added integration with data processing and memory operations
- All 531 tests still pass (100%)
- Zero lint issues

**Files Modified:**
- `vm/executor.go` - Added diagnostic tracking fields to VM struct
- `vm/cpu.go` - Added SetSPWithTrace for stack tracking
- `vm/data_processing.go` - Added stack trace recording for SP modifications

- [ ] Cycle-Accurate Timing - Per-instruction timing breakdown for performance analysis
- [ ] Symbol-Aware Trace - Enhanced trace showing function names instead of just addresses
- [ ] Diff Mode - Compare register/memory state between two execution points
- [ ] Memory Region Heatmap - Visualize which memory regions are most accessed
- [ ] Assertion/Invariant Checking - Verify user-defined conditions during execution
- [ ] Reverse Execution Log - Log sufficient state to enable stepping backwards
- [ ] Pipeline Visualization - Show instruction flow through execution stages
