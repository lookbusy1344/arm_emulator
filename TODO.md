## High Priority

### 1. End-to-End Integration Tests

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Implementation:** Comprehensive end-to-end and integration tests have been added to verify the emulator works correctly with real programs.

**Completed Features:**
- âœ… Added 12 new integration tests for complete programs
- âœ… Test arithmetic operations, loops, conditionals, function calls
- âœ… Test array operations, string operations, bitwise operations
- âœ… Test nested function calls (factorial, recursion)
- âœ… Test stack operations (PUSH/POP)
- âœ… Test shifts and rotations
- âœ… Test example programs (hello.s, arithmetic.s - working)
- âœ… All syscalls tested with real programs
- âœ… 34 integration tests total (32 passing, 93.5% pass rate)

**Known Limitations (documented below):**
- `STMFD`/`LDMFD` instructions not fully supported (affects loops.s, conditionals.s, bubble_sort.s, etc.)
- Pre-indexed addressing with writeback `[Rn, #offset]!` not supported
- Post-indexed addressing `[Rn], #offset` not supported
- Some example programs use `SVC` instead of `SWI` (same instruction, different name)
- Character literals in strings (e.g., `'\t'`) are treated as literal backslash-t, not tab
- Immediate offsets in load/store `[Rn, #offset]` have parser issues

**Test Results:**
- Total tests: 511 tests
- Passing tests: 509 (99.6% pass rate)
- Integration tests: 34 total (32 passing, 93.5% pass rate)
- Unit tests: 477 total (477 passing, 100% pass rate)

**Failing Tests (2):**
- `TestExamplePrograms_Loops` - requires character literal support (`#' '`, `#'\t'`)
- `TestExamplePrograms_Conditionals` - requires character literal support (`#'\t'`)

**Completed:** 2025-10-10

### 2. Missing ARM2 Instructions for Example Programs

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE (STMFD/LDMFD implemented)

**Completed Features (2025-10-10):**

1. **Stack Multi-Register Operations** âœ… COMPLETE
   - `STMFD` (Store Multiple, Full Descending) - âœ… implemented
   - `LDMFD` (Load Multiple, Full Descending) - âœ… implemented
   - `STMFA`, `STMEA`, `STMED` aliases - âœ… implemented
   - `LDMFA`, `LDMEA`, `LDMED` aliases - âœ… implemented
   - `SVC` instruction (ARM7+ alias for SWI) - âœ… implemented
   - All aliases properly map to existing LDM/STM implementations

**Remaining Limited Features:**

1. **Addressing Modes** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Pre-indexed with writeback: `LDR R0, [R1, #4]!` - parser errors
   - Post-indexed: `LDRB R0, [R1], #4` - parser errors
   - Immediate offset: `LDR R0, [R1, #4]` - parser errors
   - Impact: More sophisticated memory access patterns don't work
   - Workaround: Use separate ADD instructions and base register addressing
   - Effort: 3-4 hours

2. **Character Literal Escaping** (HIGH PRIORITY - blocks 2 example programs)
   - Character literals in immediates: `MOV R0, #' '` (space) and `MOV R0, #'\t'` (tab)
   - Affects: loops.s (line 26, 105), conditionals.s (line 106)
   - Impact: **2 example programs cannot run** (loops.s, conditionals.s)
   - Workaround: Use numeric values (`MOV R0, #32` for space, `MOV R0, #9` for tab)
   - Effort: 1-2 hours

**Total Effort to Support All Examples:** 4-6 hours (down from 8-12 hours)

**Priority:** Medium-High (for M8 if we want all examples working)

---

### 3. Expression Parser Improvements (Phase 5 Enhancement)

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETE

**Implementation:** The expression parser has been upgraded with a proper two-phase tokenizer and precedence-climbing parser.

**Completed Features:**
- âœ… All numeric literals work (decimal, hex, binary, octal)
- âœ… Register references work
- âœ… Symbol lookups work
- âœ… Memory dereferencing works (`[addr]`, `*addr`)
- âœ… Arithmetic operations work (`10 + 20`, `5 * 6`, `0x10 + 0x20`)
- âœ… Bitwise operations work (`0xFF & 0x0F`, `0xF0 | 0x0F`, `0xFF ^ 0x0F`)
- âœ… Shift operations work (`1 << 4`, `16 >> 2`)
- âœ… Register operations work (`r0 + r1`, `r0 + 5`, `r1 - r0`)
- âœ… Operator precedence correctly implemented
- âœ… Parentheses for grouping
- âœ… All previously disabled tests now passing

**Implementation Details:**
- Created `debugger/expr_lexer.go` - Tokenizer for debugger expressions
- Created `debugger/expr_parser.go` - Precedence-climbing parser with proper operator precedence
- Updated `debugger/expressions.go` - Refactored to use new lexer and parser
- All tests in `debugger/expressions_test.go` are now passing (100%)

**Completed:** 2025-10-10
