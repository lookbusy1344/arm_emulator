# Response to "What should next be implemented?"

Based on the comprehensive project review, here are the recommended next implementations in priority order:

## üö® Critical Fixes (Complete First - ~15 minutes)

### 1. Fix Go Vet Warnings ‚ö°
**Issue:** Interface name collision in `vm/memory.go`  
**Impact:** Code quality, potential interface compatibility issues  
**Effort:** 10 minutes

The `ReadByte` and `WriteByte` methods conflict with Go's standard `io.ByteReader` and `io.ByteWriter` interfaces.

**Solution:**
```go
// In vm/memory.go, rename:
func (m *Memory) ReadByteAt(address uint32) (byte, error)  // was ReadByte
func (m *Memory) WriteByteAt(address uint32, value byte) error  // was WriteByte
```

Then update all call sites throughout the codebase.

### 2. Update CI Go Version ‚ö°
**Issue:** CI uses Go 1.21, project requires 1.25.2  
**Impact:** Version mismatch in testing  
**Effort:** 5 minutes

**Solution:**
```yaml
# In .github/workflows/ci.yml, line 21:
go-version: "1.25"  # Change from "1.21"
```

---

## üéØ Phase 11: Production Hardening (Next Priority - 14-20 hours)

This phase will bring the project from "functionally complete" to "production-ready v1.0.0".

### 1. Cross-Platform CI Testing (4-6 hours)
**Why:** Currently only tests on Ubuntu; platform-specific bugs won't be caught  
**What:** Add matrix testing for macOS and Windows  
**Impact:** Catches platform-specific issues before users hit them

**Implementation:**
```yaml
# Update .github/workflows/ci.yml
strategy:
  matrix:
    os: [ubuntu-latest, macos-latest, windows-latest]
    go-version: ['1.25']
```

**Deliverables:**
- CI runs on all 3 platforms
- Coverage reports uploaded to codecov.io
- Coverage badge in README.md
- Minimum coverage threshold enforcement (70%)

### 2. Increase Code Coverage to 75%+ (4-6 hours)
**Why:** Currently at 61%, target is 85%; gaps in testing mean potential bugs  
**What:** Add tests for untested modules and code paths  
**Impact:** Higher confidence in code correctness

**Focus Areas:**
- **VM package:** Add `vm/vm_test.go` for VM initialization, reset, state management
- **Debugger:** Increase from 47.9% by testing expression evaluation edge cases
- **Parser:** Add tests for error handling and invalid input
- **Encoder:** Test error paths and invalid instruction encodings

**Example new test:**
```go
// vm/vm_test.go
func TestVM_ResetRegisters_PreservesMemory(t *testing.T) {
    vm := setupTestVM()
    vm.Memory.WriteWord(0x8000, 0xDEADBEEF)
    vm.Reg[0] = 42
    
    vm.ResetRegisters()
    
    // Registers should be reset
    if vm.Reg[0] != 0 {
        t.Error("Register not reset")
    }
    
    // Memory should be preserved
    val, _ := vm.Memory.ReadWord(0x8000)
    if val != 0xDEADBEEF {
        t.Error("Memory was cleared but shouldn't be")
    }
}
```

### 3. Connect Tracing to Execution (2-3 hours)
**Why:** Tracing infrastructure exists but isn't wired into the VM  
**What:** Add trace recording calls in `VM.Step()`  
**Impact:** Makes tracing feature actually usable

**Implementation:**
```go
// In vm/executor.go, modify Step() method:
func (vm *VM) Step() error {
    if vm.traceExecution {
        vm.recordExecutionTrace()
    }
    
    // ... existing execution code ...
    
    return nil
}
```

### 4. Cross-Platform Manual Testing (3-4 hours)
**Why:** Automated tests don't catch all UI and integration issues  
**What:** Create and execute testing checklist on all platforms  
**Impact:** Ensures TUI works correctly everywhere

**Testing Checklist:**
- [ ] TUI renders correctly (colors, layout, borders)
- [ ] File I/O works with platform-specific paths
- [ ] Configuration files load from correct locations
- [ ] All 17 example programs run identically
- [ ] Command-line arguments work as expected
- [ ] Debugger keyboard shortcuts work

---

## üèÉ Phase 12: Performance & Benchmarking (After Phase 11 - 14-20 hours)

Once production-ready, focus shifts to performance.

### 1. Create Benchmark Suite (4-6 hours)
**Why:** No performance metrics exist; can't measure optimization impact  
**What:** Add comprehensive benchmarks for critical paths

**Benchmarks to Add:**
```go
// vm/vm_bench_test.go
func BenchmarkExecutionLoop(b *testing.B)      // Overall VM performance
func BenchmarkMemoryRead(b *testing.B)         // Memory access speed
func BenchmarkMemoryWrite(b *testing.B)        // Memory write speed
func BenchmarkInstructionDecode(b *testing.B)  // Decode overhead
func BenchmarkFlagCalculation(b *testing.B)    // CPSR updates

// parser/parser_bench_test.go
func BenchmarkParseLargeFile(b *testing.B)     // Parser throughput
func BenchmarkLexer(b *testing.B)              // Tokenization speed
```

### 2. Profile and Optimize (8-11 hours)
**Why:** Identify and fix performance bottlenecks  
**What:** Use pprof to find hot spots, implement targeted optimizations

**Profiling:**
```bash
go test -bench=. -cpuprofile=cpu.prof ./vm
go tool pprof cpu.prof
```

**Known Optimization Opportunities:**
1. **Instruction decode cache** - Cache decoded instructions (2-3x speedup expected)
2. **Memory access patterns** - Hybrid flat/sparse arrays for memory
3. **Conditional flag calculation** - Only calculate when S suffix present

**Expected Results:**
- 2-5x execution speedup
- Reduced memory allocations
- Better cache locality

### 3. Document Performance (2-3 hours)
**Why:** Users need to know performance characteristics  
**What:** Create performance documentation with benchmark results

Create `docs/performance_characteristics.md`:
- Execution speed (instructions per second)
- Memory usage patterns
- Scalability limits
- Comparison to similar tools
- Optimization recommendations for users

---

## üöÄ Phase 13: Release Engineering (After Phase 12 - 16-22 hours)

Make the project easy to install and distribute.

### 1. Build Release Pipeline (4-6 hours)
**Why:** Manual releases are error-prone and time-consuming  
**What:** Automated binary building for all platforms

**GitHub Actions Release Workflow:**
- Cross-compile for all platforms (Linux/macOS/Windows, amd64/arm64)
- Create archives with binaries and documentation
- Generate checksums
- Create GitHub releases automatically on tag
- Upload artifacts

### 2. Create Installation Packages (6-8 hours)
**Why:** Users expect easy installation  
**What:** Platform-specific package managers

**Packages to Create:**
- **Homebrew formula** (macOS/Linux) - 2 hours
- **Chocolatey package** (Windows) - 2 hours
- **DEB package** (Debian/Ubuntu) - 2 hours
- **RPM package** (Fedora/RHEL) - 2 hours

**Installation Commands:**
```bash
# Homebrew
brew install lookbusy1344/tap/arm-emulator

# Chocolatey
choco install arm-emulator

# APT
sudo apt install arm-emulator

# From source (fallback)
go install github.com/lookbusy1344/arm-emulator@latest
```

### 3. Release Documentation (3-4 hours)
**Why:** Users need to know what's new and how to upgrade  
**What:** Professional release process

**Documents to Create:**
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Version history with changes
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - How to contribute
- **docs/installation.md** - Installation instructions
- **docs/release_checklist.md** - Release testing process

### 4. Release Testing (3-4 hours)
**Why:** Verify release actually works before publishing  
**What:** Complete release checklist

**Testing:**
- [ ] All installation methods work
- [ ] Binary sizes are reasonable
- [ ] All examples work with installed version
- [ ] Documentation is up to date
- [ ] Version numbers are correct
