## Notes

### ARM2 Syscall Convention
This emulator implements the traditional ARM2 syscall convention: `SWI #immediate_value` where the syscall number is encoded directly in the instruction. This differs from modern Linux ARM syscalls which use `SVC #0` with the syscall number in R7. The emulator uses R0-R2 for syscall arguments and return values.

### Development Practices
- Always run `go fmt ./...` before committing
- Run `golangci-lint run ./...` to check for issues
- Clear test cache before running tests: `go clean -testcache && go test ./...`
- Update PROGRESS.md after completing significant features
- Document limitations in TODO.md

### TUI Testing
TUI tests use `tcell.SimulationScreen` to avoid terminal initialization issues. The `debugger.NewTUIWithScreen()` function accepts an optional screen parameter for testing while production code uses `debugger.NewTUI()` with the default screen.

### Security Model
The emulator includes comprehensive security hardening:
- Buffer overflow protection on all syscalls
- Memory segment wraparound attack prevention
- File size limits (1MB default, 16MB max)
- File descriptor limits (1024)
- Address validation and wraparound checks
- Thread-safe stdin handling
