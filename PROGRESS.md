## Recent Updates

### 2025-10-13: Constant Expression Support Added ✅
**Action:** Implemented arithmetic expressions in pseudo-instructions (e.g., `LDR r0, =label + 12`)

**Implementation:**
- **Parser Enhancement** (`parser/parser.go`):
  - Modified `parseOperand()` to handle `+` and `-` operators after `=`
  - Builds expression string from tokens: `=label+12`, `=symbol-4`, etc.
  - Properly consumes all tokens in the expression chain
  
- **Expression Evaluator** (`encoder/encoder.go`):
  - Added `evaluateExpression()` function to parse and compute expressions
  - Added `evaluateTerm()` helper to resolve symbols or parse immediates
  - Supports both symbols and numeric literals in expressions
  - Handles decimal and hex values: `=buffer + 12`, `=base + 0x10`

- **Memory Pseudo-Instruction** (`encoder/memory.go`):
  - Updated `encodeLDRPseudo()` to use expression evaluator
  - Replaces simple symbol lookup with full expression evaluation

**Features:**
- ✅ Addition: `LDR r0, =label + 12`
- ✅ Subtraction: `LDR r1, =symbol - 4`
- ✅ Hex offsets: `LDR r2, =base + 0x0C`
- ✅ Immediate expressions: `LDR r3, =0x8000 + 16`
- ✅ Symbol resolution: Automatically looks up symbols in expressions

**Testing:**
- **Unit Tests:** `tests/unit/parser/constant_expressions_test.go`
  - 5 comprehensive test cases covering all expression types
  - All tests passing ✅
- **Real-world Validation:**
  - `LDR r0, =buffer` gives 0x8014
  - `LDR r1, =buffer + 4` gives 0x8018 (correct: 0x8014 + 4)
  - Verified with register dumps

**Known Limitation:**
- ⚠️ Labels after `.space` directives may have incorrect base addresses (separate bug)
- This affects expressions like `=label_after_space + offset`
- The expression evaluation itself works correctly

**Example Programs:**
- `examples/division.s` - Software division implementation (ARM2 lacks hardware divide)
- `examples/test_const_expr.s` - Comprehensive constant expression tests
- `examples/test_expr.s` - Simple expression validation

### 2025-10-13: High Priority Bug Discovered ❌
**Issue:** Labels after `.space` directives get incorrect addresses

**Description:**
When a label immediately follows a `.space` directive with no intervening directive/instruction, the label is assigned the address BEFORE the space allocation, not after it.

**Example:**
```assembly
buffer:     .space 12
buffer_end:            ; Gets address of buffer, not buffer+12!
```

**Impact:**
- Breaks programs relying on end-of-space markers
- Affects constant expressions using these labels
- Symbol table contains incorrect addresses

**Status:** Documented in TODO.md as high-priority bug requiring investigation

### 2025-10-12: Priority 5 Tests Completed ✅
**Action:** Completed comprehensive instruction-condition matrix testing (final priority from MISSING_TESTS.md)

**Tests Added:**
- **160 condition matrix tests** covering 5 key instructions × 16 condition codes
- File: `tests/unit/vm/instruction_condition_matrix_test.go`
- Tests: MOV, ADD, LDR, STR, B with all conditions (EQ, NE, CS, CC, MI, PL, VS, VC, HI, LS, GE, LT, GT, LE, AL, NV)
- Each condition tested in both match and no-match scenarios

**Test Progress Summary:**
- Priority 1 (Critical): 24 tests added ✅
- Priority 2 (Addressing): 35 tests added ✅
- Priority 3 (Register shifts): 56 tests added ✅
- Priority 4 (Edge cases): 65 tests added ✅
- Priority 5 (Condition matrix): 160 tests added ✅
- **Total new tests:** 340 tests
- **Total test suite:** 1016 tests (exceeds original 838 estimate by 21%)

**Test Results:**
- **Total Tests:** 1016 (up from 660 baseline)
- **Passing:** 1016/1016 (100% ✅)
- **All Priorities Complete:** ✅

### 2025-10-12: All Integration Test Failures Fixed ✅
**Action:** Fixed critical bug in halfword instruction detection that was breaking PC-relative literal pool loads

**Root Cause:**
The halfword instruction detection in `vm/inst_memory.go` was checking only bits 7 and 4, incorrectly matching regular LDR/STR instructions when the immediate offset field happened to have those bits set. For example, an offset of 184 (0xB8 = binary 10111000) has bits 7=1 and 4=1, causing normal LDR instructions to be misidentified as LDRH instructions.

**Bugs Fixed:**
1. **Halfword Detection Bug** (`vm/inst_memory.go`)
   - **Problem:** Checking only `bit7=1 AND bit4=1` incorrectly matched LDR/STR instructions
   - **Impact:** PC-relative loads (e.g., `LDR R4, =array`) failed when offset had bits 7 and 4 set
   - **Fix:** Added check for `bits[27:25]=000` to properly distinguish instruction types:
     - LDRH/STRH: `bits[27:25]=000 AND bit7=1 AND bit4=1`
     - LDR/STR: `bits[27:26]=01`
   
2. **Unit Test Address Bug** (`tests/unit/vm/instruction_condition_matrix_test.go`)
   - **Problem:** Tests used address `0x1000` which is unmapped
   - **Fix:** Changed to `0x20000` (data segment start)

**Test Results:**
- **Total Tests:** 1016
- **Passing:** 1016/1016 (100% ✅)
- **Previously Failing:** 6 integration tests now fixed
- **Lint Issues:** 0

**Integration Tests Fixed:**
- `TestOffset8WithLabel` - Array access with literal pool loading
- `TestLiteralPoolBug_ManyLiterals` - Multiple literal pool entries
- `TestExamplePrograms_Arithmetic` - Arithmetic operations
- `TestExamplePrograms_Loops` - Loop constructs
- `TestExamplePrograms_Conditionals` - Conditional execution
- Unit tests: `TestLDR_AllConditions`, `TestSTR_AllConditions`

**Key Insights:**
- The encoder was correctly encoding instructions with offset=184 (0xB8)
- The literal pool was correctly placed and contained correct values
- The VM was incorrectly decoding these instructions as LDRH instead of LDR
- This caused offset to be extracted incorrectly (0 instead of 184)
- The fix ensures proper distinction between LDR/STR and LDRH/STRH instruction formats

**Files Modified:**
- `vm/inst_memory.go` - Fixed halfword detection logic (line 22-28)
- `tests/unit/vm/instruction_condition_matrix_test.go` - Fixed test addresses (lines 313, 423)

   - Fixed I bit location: bit 22 for halfword (not bit 25)
   - Fixed offset extraction: high[11:8] + low[3:0] for immediate
   - File: `vm/inst_memory.go`

3. **BX Decoder Bug** - Fixed BX instruction recognition
   - Added BX pattern detection: bits [27:4] = 0x12FFF1

### 2025-10-11: Integer Conversion Issues Fixed ✅
**Action:** Fixed all gosec G115 integer overflow conversion warnings

**Issues Found:**
- 4 integer conversions flagged by gosec (G115 rule) in test files
- All were safe loop index conversions (int → uint32)
- Loop indices are always non-negative and bounded by slice/array lengths

**Resolution:**
- Added `#nosec G115` directives with clear justification comments

- All 660 tests pass (100%)
- golangci-lint reports 0 issues
- No G115 warnings remain

**Impact:**
- Code passes all security linters
- False positives properly documented
- Ready for production use

### 2025-10-11: "Literal Pool Memory Corruption Bug" Fixed ✅
**Action:** Resolved what appeared to be a literal pool bug - it was actually a syscall convention conflict

**Original Symptoms:**
- Programs with many `LDR Rx, =label` instructions would execute correctly
- Programs produced correct output but then crashed with "unimplemented SWI: 0xNNNNNN" errors
- Errors showed invalid SWI numbers like 0x04FFC4 (327620) or 0xCD (205)
- Initially thought to be memory corruption from literal pool placement

**Root Cause:**
- The bug was NOT related to literal pools at all!
- Traditional ARM: `SWI #0x00` = EXIT syscall (immediate value = 0)
- Linux-style ARM: `SVC #0` = syscall number in R7 register (immediate = 0)
- Both have the same encoding, creating ambiguity
- When programs executed `SWI #0x00` to exit, emulator read R7 for syscall number
- R7 contained garbage values from program execution, causing invalid syscall errors

**Fix:**
- Initially added heuristic in `ExecuteSWI()` to disambiguate the two conventions
- If immediate == 0 AND R7 <= 7: treat as Linux-style (R7 has valid syscall)
- If immediate == 0 AND R7 > 7: treat as traditional EXIT
- This allowed both conventions to coexist
- Later removed Linux-style support entirely (see below) for simplicity

**Testing:**
- All 660 tests pass (100%)
- `examples/addressing_modes.s` (8 literals) now works correctly
- `examples/arrays.s` (16 literals) now works correctly
- All example programs execute and exit cleanly

**Impact:**
- No literal pool issues exist - literal pool implementation is correct
- Programs with many literals work perfectly
- Proper program termination guaranteed

**Files Modified:**
- `vm/syscall.go` - Added disambiguation logic (commit b6c59e2)
- Later simplified when Linux-style support was removed (commit 95dcb7c)

### 2025-10-11: Linux-Style Syscall Support Removed ✅
**Action:** Removed Linux-style syscall convention to align with ARM2 specification

**Rationale:**
- Linux-style syscalls (using `SVC #0` with syscall number in R7) were not part of the original ARM2 architecture
- This was a modern extension that created ambiguity and complexity
- The heuristic-based approach (checking R7 value to distinguish conventions) was error-prone
- Caused bugs where R7 register usage in programs conflicted with syscall detection

**Changes Made:**
- Removed Linux-style syscall constants (`LINUX_SYS_EXIT`, `LINUX_SYS_PRINT_INT`, etc.)
- Removed `mapLinuxSyscall()` function
- Simplified `ExecuteSWI()` to use only immediate values from instruction encoding
- Updated syscall convention tests to remove Linux-style tests
- All example programs already used traditional ARM2 syntax (no changes needed)

**Files Modified:**
- `vm/syscall.go` - Removed Linux-style constants and simplified ExecuteSWI (lines 55-105)
- `tests/integration/syscall_convention_test.go` - Removed Linux-style tests, kept traditional tests
- `PROGRESS.md` - Updated documentation

**Testing:**
- **660 total tests passing** (100% pass rate) ✅
- All syscall tests pass with traditional ARM2 SWI syntax
- Example programs continue to work correctly

**Impact:**
- Simpler, more correct implementation aligned with ARM2 specification
- R7 is now just a general-purpose register with no special meaning
- No ambiguity in syscall handling
- Eliminates entire class of bugs related to R7 register conflicts

### 2025-10-11: Memory Trace Bug Investigation - FALSE ALARM ✅
**Action:** Investigated reported `--mem-trace` bug - discovered the feature **ACTUALLY WORKS CORRECTLY**

**Initial Report (INCORRECT):**
- Claimed the `--mem-trace` command-line flag creates empty trace files
- Claimed RecordRead() and RecordWrite() methods are never called

**Actual Testing Results:**
- Ran `./arm-emulator --mem-trace --mem-trace-file /tmp/mem_trace_test.log examples/arrays.s`
- Generated 93 lines of detailed memory trace output
- Format: `[sequence] [READ/WRITE] PC <- [address] = value (size)`
- Example: `[000000] [READ ] 0x8000 <- [0x00008208] = 0x000081B4 (WORD)`

**Verification:**
- RecordRead() and RecordWrite() ARE properly called in `vm/inst_memory.go` (lines 92, 124)
- RecordRead() and RecordWrite() ARE properly called in `vm/memory_multi.go` (lines 86, 110)
- MemoryTrace has proper nil checks before calling Record methods
- Unit tests exist in `tests/unit/vm/trace_test.go` (lines 152-246) covering MemoryTrace functionality

**Status:**
- Feature confirmed **WORKING**
- Previous bug report in PROGRESS.md was based on incorrect information
- No fix needed - infrastructure is correctly implemented

### 2025-10-11: Pre-indexed Writeback Bug Fixed ✅
**Action:** Resolved the "Pre-indexed with Writeback Instruction Bug" - it was not a bug in the addressing mode implementation!

**Root Cause:**
- The bug was in the integration test code, not in the pre-indexed writeback implementation
- Test used `LDR R7, [R6, #4]!` followed by `SWI 0x00`
- When `SWI 0x00` executes, the original VM implementation used a Linux-style syscall convention (reading syscall number from R7)
- R7 contained 100 (0x64) from the LDR, causing "unimplemented SWI: 0x000064" error
- Pre-indexed writeback parsing, encoding, and execution all work perfectly!

**Fix:**
- Changed integration test to use R2 instead of R7
- This avoided conflict with the (now removed) Linux-style syscall convention
- Integration test now passes successfully

**Note:** Linux-style syscall support has since been removed (2025-10-11) to align with ARM2 specification

**Files Modified:**
- `tests/integration/addressing_modes_test.go` - Changed test to use R2, updated comments
- `TODO.md` - Updated bug documentation to show resolution

**Testing:**
- **660 total tests passing** (100% pass rate) ✅
- Integration test `TestAddressingMode_PreIndexedWriteback_FullPipeline` now passes
- All addressing modes (immediate offset, pre-indexed writeback, post-indexed) fully tested

**Impact:**
- Pre-indexed writeback is confirmed working and can be used in programs
- No workarounds needed - the feature works as designed
- Documentation updated to reflect correct understanding

### 2025-10-11: Integration Tests Verified ✅
**Action:** Verified that all integration tests are working correctly - they were never actually broken!

**Status:**
- All 33 integration tests passing ✅
  - 22 program execution tests (arithmetic, loops, conditionals, functions, memory, etc.)
  - 11 syscall tests (console I/O operations)
- Integration tests cover the full pipeline: parser → encoder → VM execution
- Tests validate example programs: hello.s, arithmetic.s, loops.s, conditionals.s

**Files Modified:**
- `PROGRESS.md` - Corrected integration test status (section 14)

**Testing:**
- **660 total tests passing** (all phases) ✅

- `TODO.md` - Marked parser issues as complete

**Impact:**
- All parser limitations resolved
- 100% of expression parser tests passing
- No critical issues remaining in TODO.md

### 2025-10-09: TODO.md Cleanup ✅
**Action:** Cleaned up TODO.md by removing all completed items:
- Encoder (fully implemented with 1148 lines across 5 files)
- TUI Interface (complete)
- Development Tools (linter, formatter, cross-reference generator - all complete)
- Example Programs (17 complete examples)
- Documentation (core docs complete)

All completed items are documented in PROGRESS.md. TODO.md now only contains outstanding tasks.

### 2025-10-09: Debugger Run Command Fix ✅
**Issue:** The debugger's `run` command was calling `VM.Reset()` which cleared all memory, erasing the pre-loaded program. This prevented the debugger from working with programs loaded from files.

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added `VM.ResetRegisters()` method in `vm/executor.go:99` that resets only CPU registers and state while preserving memory contents
- Updated `debugger/commands.go:17` to use `ResetRegisters()` instead of `Reset()`
- All tests passing

**Files Modified:**
- `vm/executor.go` - Added `ResetRegisters()` method
- `debugger/commands.go` - Updated `cmdRun()` to use `ResetRegisters()`
- `TODO.md` - Removed completed bug from critical priority section
