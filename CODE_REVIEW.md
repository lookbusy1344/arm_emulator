- Logical organization: `vm/`, `parser/`, `debugger/`, `encoder/`, `tools/`, `config/`
- Clean dependency hierarchy (no circular dependencies observed)
- Test files properly organized in `tests/unit/` and `tests/integration/`
- Examples separated from main codebase

**Structure:**
```
.
├── main.go              # Entry point (805 lines)
├── vm/                  # Virtual machine (17 files)
├── parser/              # Assembly parser (6 files)
├── debugger/            # Debug tools (10 files)
├── encoder/             # Machine code encoder (5 files)
├── tools/               # Dev tools (6 files)
├── config/              # Configuration (2 files)
├── tests/               # Tests (organized by type)
├── examples/            # 36 example programs
└── docs/                # Comprehensive docs
```

**Minor Issues:**
- None identified. Structure is exemplary.

---

### 2. Code Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

**Strengths:**
- Clean, readable, idiomatic Go code
- Consistent naming conventions
- Good use of Go idioms (interfaces, error handling, defer)
- Proper error propagation
- No formatting issues (gofmt compliant)
- Passes go vet with no warnings
- Security-conscious (gosec linting enabled)

**Code Style Examples:**
```go
// Good error handling pattern
func (p *Parser) Parse() (*Program, error) {
    program := &Program{...}
    if err := p.firstPass(program); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    if p.errors.HasErrors() {
        return nil, p.errors
    }
    return program, nil
}

// Clear struct design
type CPU struct {
    R      [15]uint32  // General purpose registers
    PC     uint32      // Program counter
    CPSR   CPSR        // Status register
    Cycles uint64      // Cycle counter
}
```

**Areas for Improvement:**
- Some large files (2465 lines in data_processing_test.go, 908 lines in programs_test.go)
- A few functions exceed 100 lines (acceptable for complex logic but could be refactored)
- Limited use of interfaces (could improve testability in some areas)
- Some error messages could be more descriptive

**Recommendations:**
- Consider splitting large test files into focused test suites
- Extract complex functions into smaller, testable units
- Add more interfaces for dependency injection where appropriate

---

### 3. Testing Strategy ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

**Strengths:**
- Excellent test coverage with 1040 tests, 100% pass rate
- Comprehensive unit tests for all instruction types
- Good integration tests for end-to-end scenarios
- Tests are well-organized and follow Go conventions
- Table-driven tests used effectively
- Edge cases covered (overflow, underflow, boundary conditions)

**Test Breakdown:**
```
Unit Tests (976 tests):
- VM tests: 660+ tests
  - Data processing: extensive coverage
  - Memory operations: 1711 lines of tests
  - Conditions: 1001 lines of tests
  - Flags: 1404 lines total
  - Addressing modes: 613 lines
- Parser tests: comprehensive
- Debugger tests: good coverage
- Tools tests: 64 tests

Integration Tests (64 tests):
- Programs: 908 lines
- Syscalls: 708 lines
- Diagnostic flags: 580 lines
- Literal pool: 730 lines
```

**Weaknesses:**
- Only 4 of 36 example programs have automated tests (11%)
- Test coverage estimated at 40-50% (no coverage report available)
- No test coverage for encoder package (no test files)
- No test coverage for parser package at package level (tests in tests/unit/parser)
- Limited negative testing (malformed input, edge cases)

**Critical Gap:**
The low example program success rate (49%) went undetected because 89% of examples lack automated tests. This is a significant testing blind spot.

**Recommendations:**
1. **CRITICAL:** Add integration tests for all 36 example programs
2. Add test coverage reporting (codecov integration)
3. Set minimum coverage threshold (70%+)
4. Add encoder package tests
5. Add more negative test cases
6. Consider fuzzing for parser

  VM ← Machine Code ←┘
  ↓
debugger/TUI
  ↓
output (trace/stats/diagnostics)
```

**VM Architecture:**
```go
VM {
    CPU       // Processor state
    Memory    // Memory management
    Tracer    // Execution tracing
    Statistics // Performance tracking
    Coverage  // Code coverage

return fmt.Errorf("memory access violation: address 0x%08X is not mapped", addr)

// Custom error type
type ErrorList struct {
    Errors []error
}

// Good error checking
if err != nil {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to parse: %w", err)
}
```

**Weaknesses:**
- Some error messages could include more context
