## How to Release v1.0

The release process is fully automated. Simply:

```bash
# 1. Create and push the release tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release v1.0.0 - First production release"
git push origin v1.0.0

# 2. Wait for GitHub Actions to complete (5-10 minutes)
# - Builds binaries for all platforms
# - Generates SHA256 checksums
# - Creates GitHub Release with all artifacts

# 3. Verify the release
# - Check https://github.com/lookbusy1344/arm_emulator/releases
# - Verify all 4 binaries are present
# - Verify SHA256SUMS file is included
# - Download and test a binary
```

That's it! The automation handles everything else.

## Post-Release Recommendations

### Immediate (Within 24 Hours)
1. Monitor for any issues reported by early adopters
2. Verify download links work correctly
3. Check CI/CD pipeline status after tag push
4. Review GitHub Release page presentation

### Short-term (Within 1 Week)
1. Gather feedback from users
2. Address any critical bugs discovered
3. Update documentation based on user feedback
4. Consider minor patch release (v1.0.1) if needed

### Long-term (Future Releases)
Optional enhancements documented in TODO.md:
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Additional ARM architecture extensions
- Enhanced CI/CD with code coverage reporting
- More advanced diagnostic modes
- JIT compilation for performance

---

## Known Limitations (Non-Blocking)

### Minor Issues (Documented in TODO.md)
1. **TUI Tab Navigation** - Tab key cycling between panels has known issues (workaround: use mouse or command input)
2. **Parser Coverage** - At 18.2% due to complex error paths (adequate for release, can improve if bugs found)
3. **No Benchmarks** - Performance benchmarks not yet implemented (optional for v1.0)

### Anti-Virus False Positives (Documented)
- Windows Defender may flag the binary as a false positive
- Due to legitimate emulator behavior patterns
- Comprehensive security audit in SECURITY.md explains why it's safe
- Users can build from source if concerned

**None of these issues are blockers for v1.0 release.**
