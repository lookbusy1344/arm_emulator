- Memory inspection with hex/ASCII display
- Register viewing with change highlighting
- Symbol-aware display (shows function/label names)

#### System & Syscalls
- 35+ system calls across 6 categories:
  - Console I/O (8 syscalls): EXIT, WRITE_CHAR, WRITE_STRING, WRITE_INT, READ_CHAR, READ_STRING, READ_INT, WRITE_NEWLINE
  - File Operations (7 syscalls): OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE, SEEK, TELL, FILE_SIZE

- FAQ with 50+ questions and answers
- API reference for developers

**Developer Documentation:**
- Detailed architecture overview
- Implementation plan (10 phases)
- Development progress tracking

- Code review summary

#### Example Programs
49 fully working example programs demonstrating:
- Basic concepts (hello world, arithmetic)
- Algorithms (fibonacci, factorial, sorting, searching, GCD)
- Data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, hash tables, strings)
- Advanced topics (functions, conditionals, loops)
- System features (file I/O, memory management, syscalls)
- Multi-precision arithmetic (128-bit addition)
- Interactive programs (calculator, bubble sort, fibonacci)

### Security
- Comprehensive security audit completed
- Zero security vulnerabilities detected
- Memory bounds checking on all operations
- Permission system (read/write/execute) for memory segments
- Stack overflow detection
- Safe integer conversions with overflow protection
- Input validation on all user data
- No network connectivity (completely offline)
- No system file modifications (only user-specified files)
- All dependencies verified as legitimate and safe

### Testing
- **969 comprehensive tests** (100% pass rate)
  - ~905 unit tests covering all packages
  - 64 integration tests with full end-to-end execution
- **75% code coverage** across all packages
- Zero linting issues (golangci-lint)
- Zero race conditions detected
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing

### Performance
- Efficient memory model with proper segmentation
- Minimal allocations in hot paths
- Statistics collection with negligible overhead
- Dynamic literal pool sizing for optimal space usage

### Build & Release
- Automated GitHub Actions workflow for releases
- Multi-platform binaries (Linux AMD64, macOS ARM64, Windows AMD64/ARM64)
- SHA256 checksums for all binaries
- Combined SHA256SUMS file for easy verification
- Optimized release builds with `-ldflags="-s -w"`

### Known Limitations
- Parser coverage at 18.2% (complex error paths not fully tested, but adequate)
- No performance benchmarks yet (documented for future work)
- TUI tab key navigation has known issues (documented in TODO.md)

### Development Statistics
- **Development Time:** ~53 hours over 14 days
- **Tools Used:** Claude Code, GitHub Copilot
- **Lines Per Hour:** ~840 (or ~6,700 lines per 8-hour day)
- **Test Pass Rate:** 100% throughout development
- **Zero Critical Bugs:** All tests passing at release

### Notes
- This is an educational ARM2 emulator, not intended for production ARM code execution
- Implements classic ARM2 architecture (not Linux-style syscall convention)
- Some features extend beyond pure ARM2 (ARMv3 PSR transfer, ARMv3M long multiply) for enhanced compatibility
- Windows anti-virus may flag the binary as a false positive due to legitimate emulator behavior patterns (see SECURITY.md)
