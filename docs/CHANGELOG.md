## [Unreleased]

### October 2025 Updates

#### 2025-10-23: Security Analysis - Memory Segment Wraparound Protection
**Status:** Complete - Investigated reported wraparound vulnerability, confirmed code is secure

A security concern was raised regarding potential wraparound vulnerability in `vm/memory.go:92-97`. After comprehensive analysis:

- **Result:** NO VULNERABILITY EXISTS
- **Root Cause:** Original comment was misleading, suggesting wraparound reliance when code actually uses explicit bounds checking
- **Actions Taken:**
  - Added 3 new security tests (wraparound protection scenarios)
  - Improved documentation in `vm/memory.go` (lines 85-97)
  - Verified security model with edge case testing
- **Test Results:** All 1,024 tests pass (100% âœ…)
- **Files Modified:** `vm/memory.go` (documentation), `tests/unit/vm/memory_system_test.go` (new tests)

#### 2025-10-19: TUI Memory Write Highlighting
**Status:** Complete - Memory writes now visually highlighted in green in TUI debugger

**Features Added:**
- Automatic memory trace integration in TUI mode
- Green highlighting for written bytes in Memory window
- Auto-focus to written addresses
- Works for all store instructions (STR, STRB, STRH, STMFD, etc.)

**Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed stack pointer reset in `ResetRegisters()`
- Fixed source view truncation (square brackets interpreted as color tags)
- Fixed memory window layout (1:1 proportions for full 16-byte rows)
- Fixed breakpoint detection in both run and step modes

**Files Modified:** `debugger/tui.go`, `vm/executor.go`

#### 2025-10-18: Comprehensive Syscall Testing
**Status:** Complete test coverage for syscalls 0x30-0x33 and 0xF0-0xF4

**New Example Programs (4 total):**
- `test_get_time.s` - GET_TIME syscall demonstration
- `test_get_random.s` - GET_RANDOM syscall with distribution tests
- `test_get_arguments.s` - GET_ARGUMENTS syscall
- `test_debug_syscalls.s` - All debugging syscalls (DEBUG_PRINT, DUMP_REGISTERS, DUMP_MEMORY, ASSERT)

**Tests Added:**
- 13 new unit tests (system information and debugging syscalls)
- 9 new integration tests (end-to-end syscall execution)
- All 4 example programs execute successfully

**Files Modified:** `tests/unit/vm/syscall_test.go`, `tests/integration/syscalls_test.go`

#### 2025-10-18: Critical Bug Fixes - Security Hardening
**Status:** Five critical bugs fixed with comprehensive test coverage

**Bugs Fixed:**

1. **Global Heap Allocator State Bug (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Problem: Heap allocator used global variables, causing race conditions and state leakage
   - Fix: Moved state to per-instance fields in Memory struct
   - Impact: Thread safety for concurrent VM instances

2. **File Descriptor Race Condition (CRITICAL)**
   - Problem: File descriptor mutex was global variable
   - Fix: Moved `fdMu` to per-instance VM struct field
   - Impact: Thread-safe file operations

3. **REALLOCATE Syscall Not Copying Data (HIGH PRIORITY)**
   - Problem: REALLOCATE allocated new memory but didn't copy old data
   - Fix: Implemented proper data copying and error handling
   - Impact: Data preservation during reallocation

4. **Heap Allocation Overflow Not Checked (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
   - Problem: No overflow check when `nextHeapAddress + size` wraps
   - Fix: Added overflow check before allocation
   - Impact: Prevention of allocations outside heap bounds

5. **Test Logic Flaws**
   - Fixed `TestHeapAllocatorPerInstance` incorrect expectations
   - Fixed `TestHeapOverflowCheck` overflow detection order

**Test Suite:** 15 new tests added, all 1,200+ tests passing (100%)

**Files Modified:** `vm/memory.go`, `vm/syscalls.go`, `tests/unit/vm/code_review_fixes_test.go`

**Changes:**
- Removed Linux-style constants and `mapLinuxSyscall()`
- Simplified `ExecuteSWI()` to use only immediate values
- All example programs already used ARM2 syntax

**Files Modified:** `vm/syscall.go`, `tests/integration/syscall_convention_test.go`
