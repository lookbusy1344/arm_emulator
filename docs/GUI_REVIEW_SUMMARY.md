## What's Working Well ✅

### Architecture (5/5)
- **Excellent separation of concerns**: Clean 3-tier design (React → Service → VM)
- **Type safety**: TypeScript + Go with proper interfaces
- **Thread-safe**: Service layer uses mutexes correctly
- **Modern stack**: Wails v2, React 18, Vite, Vitest

### Code Quality (4/5)
- **Go backend**: Idiomatic, well-structured, security-conscious
- **React frontend**: Modern hooks, clean components
- **Service layer**: Overflow protection, input validation
- **Test coverage**: 19 passing tests for implemented features

### What's Implemented
- ✅ Register view (R0-R15, CPSR flags)
- ✅ Memory inspector with hex dump
- ✅ Basic controls (Load/Step/Run/Pause/Reset)
- ✅ Code editor
- ✅ Error display
- ✅ Thread-safe backend service

---

## Critical Issues ⚠️

### 1. Security Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL)
```
5 moderate severity vulnerabilities in npm dependencies:
- esbuild <=0.24.2
- vite (depends on vulnerable esbuild)
- vitest (depends on vulnerable vite)
```

**Action Required:**
```bash
cd gui/frontend
npm audit fix
# May require --force for breaking changes
```

### 2. React Testing Warnings (CRITICAL)
4 instances of:
```
Warning: An update to App inside a test was not wrapped in act(...)
```

**Action Required:** Wrap async state updates in `act()` in test files.

### 3. Continue() Method Confusion (HIGH)
Backend `Continue()` just sets flags but doesn't actually run the VM.

**Action Required:** Either rename or make it call `RunUntilHalt()`.

## Missing Features 🚧

Planned but not yet implemented in UI:

| Feature | Backend Support | UI Status |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Breakpoints | ✅ Yes | ❌ No UI |
| Console Output | ✅ EventWriter ready | ❌ Not integrated |
| Disassembly View | ✅ GetDisassembly() | ❌ Not shown |
| Source Line Highlight | ✅ GetSourceLine() | ❌ No panel |
| Symbol Inspector | ✅ GetSymbols() | ❌ Not displayed |
| Stack View | ✅ GetStack() | ❌ Not implemented |
| Performance Stats | ✅ Cycles available | ❌ No metrics UI |
| File Operations | ❌ Not in backend | ❌ No UI |

---

## Code Metrics

```
Total Lines:
  Go:        ~650 lines (3 files)
  TypeScript: ~730 lines (11 files)
  CSS:        ~280 lines (3 files)
  Tests:      ~348 lines (6 test files)
  Total:    ~2,008 lines

Test Results:
  Go:     2/2 passing (gui/app_test.go)
  React: 19/19 passing (with 4 warnings)
  
Build Status:
  Frontend: ✅ Builds successfully
  Go:       ⚠️ Requires frontend/dist
```

## Priority Actions

### Immediate (Before Production)
1. ✅ **Complete this review** → DONE
2. 🔴 **Fix security vulnerabilities** → `npm audit fix`
3. 🔴 **Fix React act() warnings** → Wrap tests properly
4. 🟡 **Clarify Continue() behavior** → Rename or fix implementation

### Near Term (Next Sprint)
5. 🟡 Add breakpoint UI
6. 🟡 Integrate console output
7. 🟡 Add error boundary
8. 🟢 Document build process

### Future Enhancements
9. 🟢 Add syntax highlighting (Monaco/CodeMirror)
10. 🟢 Add disassembly view
11. 🟢 Add keyboard shortcuts
12. 🟢 Improve memory view (virtual scrolling)

---

## Architecture Highlights

### Service Layer Pattern
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  React Frontend │  ← User Interface (TypeScript)
└────────┬────────┘
         │ Wails Bridge
┌────────▼────────┐
│ DebuggerService │  ← Thread-safe API (Go)
└────────┬────────┘
         │
┌────────▼────────┐
│   VM & Parser   │  ← Core Emulator (Go)
└─────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Thread-safety built in
- Testable at each layer
- Reusable service layer (CLI, TUI, GUI)

---

## Recommendations

### For Production Use
1. ✅ Architecture is production-ready
2. ⚠️ Fix security vulnerabilities first
3. ⚠️ Resolve React testing warnings
4. ⚠️ Complete missing features or document limitations
5. ✅ Code quality is acceptable

### For Continued Development
- **Add features incrementally** - Foundation is solid
- **Maintain test coverage** - Keep tests updated as features grow
- **Consider design system** - For consistency as UI grows
- **Add E2E tests** - For critical workflows
- **Monitor dependencies** - Keep npm packages updated

---

## Conclusion

The GUI implementation demonstrates **strong engineering fundamentals** with excellent architecture and clean code. The foundation is solid enough to support the remaining planned features.

**Main Strengths:**
- Well-designed architecture with proper separation
- Type-safe and thread-safe implementation  
- Modern tech stack with good tooling
- Security-conscious backend design
- Good test coverage for implemented features

**Main Concerns:**
- Security vulnerabilities in npm dependencies
- Some planned features not yet in UI
- Minor testing issues to resolve
- Documentation could be more comprehensive

**Verdict:** ✅ **Approved with conditions** - Fix critical security issues and testing warnings, then continue building features incrementally.

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Fix npm security vulnerabilities
2. Address React testing warnings  
3. Clarify/fix Continue() behavior
4. Add missing features per priority
5. Update documentation

**Estimated Effort:**
- Security fixes: 1 hour
- Testing fixes: 2 hours
- Continue() fix: 1 hour
- Missing features: 2-3 sprints
