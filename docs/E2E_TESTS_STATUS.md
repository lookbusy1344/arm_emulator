# E2E Tests Status

## Overview

This document tracks the current status of all E2E tests for the ARM Emulator GUI. For the original implementation plan, see [E2E_TESTING_PLAN.md](./E2E_TESTING_PLAN.md).

**Last Updated**: November 2025

## Test Infrastructure

- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Browsers**: Chromium, WebKit, Firefox (configured)
- **Execution Mode**: Serial (`workers: 1`) to prevent VM state conflicts
- **Location**: `gui/frontend/e2e/`

### Key Configuration

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
{
  fullyParallel: false,  // Tests run serially
  workers: 1,            // Single worker prevents state conflicts
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  timeout: 30000         // 30s per test
}
```

### Why Serial Execution?

The Wails backend has a single VM instance shared across all browser contexts. Running tests in parallel causes:
- State pollution (wrong PC values, polluted registers)
- Leftover breakpoints from previous tests
- Output mixing between tests

Serial execution with proper beforeEach cleanup ensures clean VM state for each test.

## Test Suites Summary

## Detailed Test Status

### 1. execution.spec.ts ✅ (8/8 passing)

**Status**: Fully operational, all tests passing consistently in serial mode.

**Test Coverage**:

#### ✅ should execute hello world program
- Loads hello world program via `LoadProgramFromSource()`
- Switches to output tab before execution (critical for event capture)
- Runs program to completion
- Verifies "Hello, World!" appears in output

**Key Fix**: OutputView must be mounted before program runs to catch `vm:output` events.

#### ✅ should step through fibonacci program
- Loads fibonacci program
- Steps through multiple instructions
- Verifies PC changes after each step
- Verifies registers change (R0 non-zero after 10 steps)

#### ✅ should pause infinite loop
- Loads infinite loop program
- Starts execution
- Pauses after 300ms
- Verifies stepping works after pause

#### ✅ should reset program state
- Loads fibonacci and executes 5 steps
- Resets VM
- Verifies PC returns to entry point (0x00008000)

#### ✅ should execute arithmetic operations
- Loads arithmetic test program
- Steps through 6 instructions with 100ms waits
- Verifies results:
  - R2 = 0x0000001E (30 = 10 + 20)
  - R3 = 0x0000000A (10 = 20 - 10)
  - R4 = 0x000000C8 (200 = 10 × 20)

#### ✅ should step over function calls
- Loads fibonacci program
- Executes step over
- Verifies PC changed (500ms wait for completion)

#### ✅ should complete program execution
- Loads hello world program
- Runs to completion (10s timeout)
- Switches to status tab
- Verifies status is "halted" or "exited"

#### ✅ should preserve CPSR flags across steps
- Steps through fibonacci 10 times
- Verifies CPSR flags are defined after each step

**Helper Functions**:
- `loadProgram()` - Calls `window.go.main.App.LoadProgramFromSource()` directly
- `waitForExecution()` - Waits for execution-status to not be "running"
- `waitForOutput()` - Waits for output text to appear (10s timeout)

**Test Execution Time**: 10.4s (serial)

---

### 2. smoke.spec.ts 🟡 (4 tests, untested)

**Status**: Implemented but not recently verified.

**Test Coverage**:

#### should load the application
- Verifies page title contains "ARM Emulator"

#### should display all main UI elements
- Checks toolbar buttons visible (Load, Step, Step Over, Run, Reset)
- Checks tabs visible (Source, Disassembly, Output, Breakpoints)
- Checks views visible (RegisterView, MemoryView, StackView)

#### should switch between tabs
- Switches to disassembly view, verifies visible
- Switches to source view, verifies visible
- Switches to breakpoints tab, verifies active class

#### should respond to keyboard shortcuts
- Tests F11 (Step), F10 (Step Over), F5 (Run), F9 (Toggle Breakpoint)

**Next Steps**: Run and verify all tests pass.

---

### 3. breakpoints.spec.ts 🟡 (9 tests, untested)

**Status**: Implemented but not verified.

**Test Coverage**:

#### Breakpoint Management
- should add breakpoint at current PC
- should remove breakpoint
- should toggle breakpoint on/off
- should set breakpoint via F9 keyboard shortcut
- should display breakpoints in breakpoints tab

#### Execution Control
- should stop at breakpoint during run
- should continue after hitting breakpoint
- should handle multiple breakpoints
- should clear all breakpoints on reset

**Dependencies**:
- `GetBreakpoints()` backend method
- `AddBreakpoint()` / `RemoveBreakpoint()` backend methods
- Breakpoints tab UI

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify backend methods work correctly
2. Add beforeEach cleanup to clear breakpoints
3. Run tests and fix any timing issues

---

### 4. memory.spec.ts 🟡 (15 tests, untested)

**Status**: Implemented but not verified.

**Test Coverage**:

#### Memory Navigation
- should navigate to specific address
- should scroll through memory
- should display memory in hex format
- should handle invalid addresses gracefully

#### Memory Content
- should display memory changes after execution
- should highlight modified memory
- should display stack memory correctly
- should update on register changes

#### Memory View Features
- should allow address input
- should support different view modes (hex, ASCII)
- should display memory regions (code, data, stack, heap)
- should handle memory watchpoints
- should refresh on step/execution

#### Stack Operations
- should display stack frames
- should track stack pointer movement
- should highlight stack writes

**Dependencies**:
- `GetMemory()` backend method
- MemoryView component with address navigation
- Stack tracking

**Known Issues**:
- Memory view may not update in real-time during continuous execution
- Need to verify event handling for `vm:state-changed`

**Next Steps**:
1. Verify GetMemory() works correctly
2. Test address navigation
3. Add tests for edge cases (invalid addresses, boundary conditions)

---

### 5. visual.spec.ts 🟡 (20 tests, ~4 passing)

**Status**: Needs baseline regeneration after serial execution changes.

**Test Coverage**:

#### Initial State (8 tests)
- ❌ should match initial state screenshot
- ❌ should match register view after execution
- ❌ should match memory view screenshot
- ❌ should match source view with program loaded
- ❌ should match disassembly view
- ❌ should match output view with program output
- ❌ should match breakpoints tab
- ❌ should match status tab

#### Toolbar States (3 tests)
- ✅ should match toolbar in initial state
- ✅ should match toolbar with program loaded
- ✅ should match toolbar during execution

#### Responsive Layout (3 tests)
- ❌ should match layout on tablet viewport (768×1024)
- ❌ should match layout on mobile viewport (375×667)
- ❌ should match layout on large desktop (1920×1080)

#### Execution States (3 tests)
- ❌ should match UI in paused state
- ❌ should match UI after program completion
- ❌ should match UI at breakpoint

#### Themes (2 tests - skipped)
- ⏭️ should match dark mode (not implemented)
- ⏭️ should match light mode (not implemented)

#### Component States (3 tests)
- ❌ should match register view with changed values
- ❌ should match memory view with data
- ✅ should match stack view during execution

**Failure Reason**: Baselines created during parallel execution (7 workers), now tests run serially with different timing and cleanup. Pixel differences are minor (0.01-0.04 ratio).

**Next Steps**:
1. Regenerate baselines with serial execution
2. May need to kill existing Wails dev server before running with `--update-snapshots`
3. Verify all screenshots are stable

**Command to regenerate**:
```bash
# Stop any running Wails servers first
npm run test:e2e -- visual.spec.ts --update-snapshots --project=chromium
```

---

### 6. examples.spec.ts 🟡 (11 tests, untested)

**Status**: Implemented but not verified. Tests load and execute real example programs.

**Test Coverage**:

Tests each example program from `examples/` directory:
- should execute hello.s
- should execute loops.s
- should execute arithmetic.s
- should execute conditionals.s
- should execute functions.s
- should execute factorial.s
- should execute recursive_fib.s
- should execute strings.s
- should execute arrays.s
- should execute quicksort.s
- should execute linked_list.s

**Approach**:
- Reads actual .s files from examples directory
- Loads via `LoadProgramFromSource()`
- Runs to completion (10s timeout)
- Verifies execution state is "Exited" or "Halted"

**Challenges**:
- Interactive programs (bubble_sort.s, calculator.s, fibonacci.s) need stdin
- May need longer timeouts for complex programs
- Need to handle programs that don't exit cleanly

**Next Steps**:
1. Fix ES module path for examples directory
2. Test with non-interactive examples first
3. Add stdin support for interactive examples
4. Increase timeout for complex programs (quicksort, hash_table)

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. Output Capture (November 2025)
**Problem**: Programs produced output but GUI didn't display it.

**Root Cause**: VM wrote to os.Stdout, but OutputView listened for `vm:output` events.

**Solution**: Created EventEmittingWriter in `gui/app.go`:
```go
type EventEmittingWriter struct {
    ctx context.Context
}

func (w *EventEmittingWriter) Write(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
    if w.ctx != nil {
        runtime.EventsEmit(w.ctx, "vm:output", string(p))
    }
    return len(p), nil
}
```

Set during startup:
```go
func (a *App) startup(ctx context.Context) {
    outputWriter := &EventEmittingWriter{ctx: ctx}
    a.machine.OutputWriter = outputWriter
}
```

**Impact**: Output-based tests now work correctly.

---

### 2. Test Isolation (November 2025)
**Problem**: Tests passed individually but failed in parallel. State pollution caused wrong PC values, polluted registers, leftover breakpoints.

**Root Cause**: Wails backend has single VM instance shared across all browser contexts.

**Solution**:
1. Set `workers: 1` and `fullyParallel: false` in playwright.config.ts
2. Added beforeEach cleanup in execution tests:
```typescript
test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {
  appPage = new AppPage(page);
  registerView = new RegisterViewPage(page);
  await appPage.goto();

  // Reset VM and clear all breakpoints
  await appPage.clickReset();
  await page.waitForTimeout(200);

  // Clear any existing breakpoints
  const breakpoints = await page.evaluate(() => {
    return window.go.main.App.GetBreakpoints();
  });

  for (const bp of breakpoints) {
    await page.evaluate((address) => {
      return window.go.main.App.RemoveBreakpoint(address);
    }, bp.Address);
  }
}
```

**Impact**: All execution tests now pass consistently (8/8).

**Tradeoff**: Serial execution is slower (10.4s vs 2.8s) but reliability is essential.

---

### 3. Component Mounting Order (November 2025)
**Problem**: Hello world test timed out waiting for output even with event emission working.

**Root Cause**: OutputView must be mounted and listening BEFORE program runs. Events fire immediately during execution.

**Solution**: Switch to output tab before running:
```typescript
test('should execute hello world program', async () => {
  await loadProgram(appPage, TEST_PROGRAMS.hello);

  // Switch to output tab BEFORE running
  await appPage.switchToOutputTab();

  await appPage.clickRun();
  await waitForExecution(appPage.page);
  await waitForOutput(appPage.page);

  const output = await appPage.getOutputText();
  expect(output).toContain('Hello, World!');
});
```

**Impact**: Output capture now works reliably.

---

### 4. Button Selector Strict Mode (November 2025)
**Problem**: `getByRole('button', { name: 'Step' })` matched multiple buttons.

**Root Cause**: Playwright does substring matching by default, so "Step" matched "Step", "Step Over", and "Step Out".

**Solution**: Add `exact: true` to all button selectors:
```typescript
this.stepButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Step', exact: true });
this.stepOverButton = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Step Over', exact: true });
```

**Impact**: All visual tests pass strict mode validation.

**Plan**: Regenerate all baselines after ensuring Wails dev server is only instance running.

---

### 2. Example Program Tests Untested ⚠️
**Status**: Not started

**Issue**: Path resolution for examples directory may have ES module issues.

**Plan**:
1. Fix `import.meta.url` path resolution
2. Test with simple examples first
3. Handle interactive programs separately

---

### 3. Memory and Breakpoint Tests Untested ⚠️
**Status**: Not started

**Issue**: Haven't verified these test suites work with current backend.

**Plan**: Run each suite and fix issues as discovered.

## Contributing

### Adding New Tests

1. **Choose appropriate test file** based on functionality
2. **Follow existing patterns** (Page Object Model, helpers)
3. **Add proper waits** (no fixed timeouts unless necessary)
4. **Test in isolation** (run single test to verify)
5. **Test in suite** (run full suite to check for conflicts)
6. **Update this document** with new test details

### Test Writing Guidelines

#### Do ✅
- Use Page Object Models for UI interactions
- Use semantic selectors (role, label, text)
- Add data-testid attributes for unique elements
- Wait for conditions, not fixed timeouts
- Test one thing per test
- Give tests descriptive names
- Clean up state in beforeEach/afterEach

#### Don't ❌
- Use CSS class selectors (they change)
- Use fixed timeouts (use waitFor* functions)
- Test multiple features in one test
- Rely on test execution order
- Leave debug statements (console.log)
- Skip cleanup (causes state pollution)
